# HW2: Preprocessing & GLM
[1] Preprocessing and GLM
(a) Perform preprocessing and GLM using `afni_proc.py` script. Following steps should be included
1. despiking
2. slice timing correction
3. motoin correction
4. spatial normalization to the MNI space with 3 mm isotropic voxel size
5. scaling of the voxel intensity to an average of 100
6. temporal detrending
Use subjects' EPI and anatomoical files for alignment

(b) Review your overall results including the estimated neuronal activations from the GLm as summarized in the `afni_proc.py QC(APQC)` with a `html` format.

[2] Statistical Analysis
```bash
From Class 11.24(Tue) - t-test
```
(a) Perform **one-sample t-test** for each of the four tasks

(b) Perform all the **paired t-test** for the pairs of the tasks(e.g. ad vs lh, ad vs rh ... and so on.)

(c) Perform one-way repeated measures ANOVA using the results from all the four tasks(i.e. suppose there are four factors and one group)

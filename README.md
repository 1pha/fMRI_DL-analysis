# Attend and Decode fMRI with Transformers - BRI609 Term Project(Daehyun Cho)

## Motivation
Always had in mind to anaylze fMRI data with Deep learning method. Since neuroscience, neuroimaging nurished deep learning fields in many way, I this would help in the opposite way too. Some people already took their step to this and very thankful to what they've done. :pray:
